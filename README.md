# dev-server
a dev server like you get in react, but without having to use react

# How it works
So there is a CLI with which you start the server. You simply give it the route to the file you'd like to have served and it will serve it.
It'll look in a continous loop if there have been any changes, if yes, then it'll update, if no then not.
Maybe it'll do that with ajax
